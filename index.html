            <p>Froggy Swing is my first fully featured game. I implemented everything myself, including programming, design, art, and sound. I wanted to make something small in scope so I could experience the full development cycle while focusing on polish. It was developed in Unity and coded in C#. </p>
            <p>Highlights include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Movement mechanics that add a twist to the classic Endless Runner <a href="https://github.com/sequoian/froggy-swing-public/blob/master/Player.cs">[Player.cs]</a></li>

            <p>With Grapple Gear, I wanted to create a platformer that felt great to play. During development, I learned a lot about dividing complex and intertwined gameplay logic into more manageable components. This was my first major Unity project, and I even tried my hand and sound design and music composition.</p>

            <p>After reading Game Engine Architecture, I felt compelled to apply what I learned and make my own 3D game engine. Written entirely in C++, I followed many industry best practices to create an engine that is fast and efficient. In addition, I developed a small game to make sure I had created all the necessary features and that they all worked together.</p>

            <p>Back in 2015, using C++ with SDL2, I plunged head first into my first non-trivial game. In the process, I ended up developing an ad hoc game engine and level editor. The code may be crude, but I’m proud of what I was able to accomplish.</p>

            <h3>Crash Report</h3>
            <p>
              While working at Ready At Dawn, I wrote a Python script that helped programmers identify which crashes affected the largest portion of the Echo VR player base within a specific time frame. This helped the team prioritize the crashes that needed to be fixed first. The script pulled crash data from Bug Splat and player data from Kibana. It used the data to calculate the percentage of players affected by each crash and then generated an email report, complete with graphs showing the crash trends over time.

            <h3>QA Summary Report</h3>
            <p>
              I wrote a Python script for the Ready At Dawn QA team that generated emails summmarizing the team’s daily activities. It pulled data from Jira, and it organized and presented the data in attractive tables. Also, since each project had different needs, I allowed the script to be customized, both in presentation and content, by modifying a JSON file.

              That’s this website you are on right now! My focus was to create something that was both pleasing and minimalist as to not distract from the content. I used mobile-first responsive design, and made sure it looked good on wide screens as well as on screens 320 pixels wide.
